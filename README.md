## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Experienced IT Recruiter with intermediate English proficiency, full-cycle recruitment expertise, and a background in screening, sourcing, interviewing, vacancy creation, email writing, and feedback. With 3.5 years in customer support and 2 years in sales, I have honed valuable soft skills such as negotiation, persuasion, and effective communication, including business correspondence. This allowed me to establish a culture of professional communication with clients, expand the market segment I managed, and surpass sales targets, achieving a remarkable 94% increase during off-season months and an 83% increase by low season. I am a quick learner and consistently delivered profits ahead of schedule. Additionally, my background as a French philologist and teacher equips me to mentor and educate new colleagues, and my leadership abilities have enabled me to implement successful departmental strategies and step in as a team leader when needed.
